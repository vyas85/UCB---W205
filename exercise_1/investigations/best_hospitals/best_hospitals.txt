The following are hospitals which based on the analysis are top 10 in terms of standard of care.

Methodology:
1. Emergency Rooms  were excluded from the analysis since the analysis is to be performed per procedure
2. Surgical reporting metrics were excluded from the analysis
3. For most of the metrics, the scaling was consistent (0-100). There were two metrics (OP_3b and OP_5) which described median time to transfer a patient. These metrics were excluded
4. The methodology used the average score across procedures at the various hospitals
